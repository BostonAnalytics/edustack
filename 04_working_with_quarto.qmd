# Reproducible Documents with Quarto

Here is a cleaned, consolidated version written as **notes + instructions**, with redundant headings merged, flow improved, and intent made clearer for students. All existing images/embeds and their locations are preserved exactly.

## Overview & definitions

A **reproducible document** is a file (or a small collection of files) that combines written content—text, tables, figures, equations—with **the code or instructions required to generate that content**. The goal is simple but powerful: given the same data and the same code, the document can be regenerated with identical results.

Reproducible documents are foundational to transparent and verifiable research. They allow others (including your future self) to inspect how results were produced, verify claims, and extend the work without guesswork or manual reconstruction. In applied analytics, this also means fewer copy–paste errors and a clearer audit trail from data to insight.

Closely related is the idea of **literate programming**, a way of writing programs where **code and explanation live together**. Instead of treating documentation as an afterthought, literate programming treats explanation as a first-class component of the work. Code is embedded alongside human-readable text that explains *why* something is done, not just *how*.

The modern reproducible workflow blends these two ideas:
you write explanations in natural language, embed executable code, and generate polished outputs from a single source.


## Literate programming in practice

Literate programming follows a simple pattern:

* Write explanations in a natural language
* Interleave those explanations with short, meaningful code snippets
* Treat the document itself as the primary artifact

From this single source file, two key operations are possible:

* **Weaving**: producing a finished document that includes code, outputs, figures, and narrative
* **Tangling**: extracting the code into a standalone script that can be run independently

Historically, this approach appeared in the R ecosystem as **Sweave**, which combined LaTeX for text and mathematics with embedded R code. This was later generalized and simplified through **knitr** and **R Markdown**.

Today, **Quarto** supersedes these tools across both R and Python ecosystems. It supports:

* Multiple programming languages
* Multiple output formats
* Integration with Jupyter notebooks
* Polyglot documents that mix languages in a single file

For this course, Quarto is the unifying layer that connects analysis, writing, and publishing.


## Reproducible documents

Reproducible documents are the practical application of literate programming to analytics, research, and communication.

The workflow looks like this:

* Place text and code in the same document
* Ensure the code has access to the data it needs
* Render (weave) the document so results appear inline
* Regenerate the document whenever data or assumptions change

If the inputs do not change, the output does not change. That is reproducibility.

Because the source file contains both logic and explanation, readers can always trace results back to their origin. The same source can also be reused to create **multiple outputs**—for example, a report, a slide deck, and a website—without rewriting the analysis.

> The primary goal is not to document code.
> The goal is to **produce documents**: reports, slides, websites, blogs, books.
>
> Code exists to serve the output, not the other way around.


## Tool-sets

Reproducible documents combine two components:

* Natural language text (with a lightweight markup)
* A scripting or programming language

Common toolsets include:

| Toolset           | Natural language text | Scripting language                   | Requirement                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Sweave            | LaTeX                 | R                                    | {{< fa brands r-project >}} |
| Jupyter notebooks | Markdown              | Python and other kernels             | {{< fa brands python >}}    |
| R Markdown        | Markdown              | R (plus Python, shell, others)       | {{< fa brands r-project >}} |
| Quarto            | Markdown              | R, Python, Julia, JavaScript, others | Independent                 |                                      

Many other literate programming systems exist, but Quarto provides the broadest and most modern foundation for analytics-focused work.


## Programming languages and environment

This chapter assumes you already have a basic analytics environment available. You do **not** need to master every tool immediately, but you should ensure the following are installed and accessible:

* Python (or Anaconda)
* R
* Jupyter
* Quarto
* An editor such as RStudio, VS Code, or Antigravity

Cloud-based tools such as Google Colab can be used as alternatives in some cases, but local installation is preferred for reproducibility and long-term projects.

If you encounter installation issues, [MET IT](https://www.bu.edu/metit/) can assist with setting up the required software for the course.



## Markdown

[Optional content]{.uugreen-bold}

This section can be covered briefly in class. Students can review and practice at their own pace.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text using simple, readable syntax. It is widely used for documentation, reports, and web content because it is easy to write and easy to convert into formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word.

Markdown matters because it sits at the center of modern reproducible workflows.

### Why Markdown is used in analytics

Markdown supports:

- [Documentation]{.uugreen-bold}: clear explanations alongside code
- [Readability]{.uugreen-bold}: structured text without visual clutter
- [Collaboration]{.uugreen-bold}: easy review and editing by teams
- [Version control]{.uugreen-bold}: clean diffs in Git compared to binary formats
- [Presentation]{.uugreen-bold}: seamless integration of text, code, and visuals
- [Reproducibility]{.uugreen-bold}: concise pairing of explanation and execution
- [Portability]{.uugreen-bold}: platform-independent plain text files
- [Efficiency]{.uugreen-bold}: minimal syntax, focus on content rather than formatting

Files such as `README.md`, `.qmd`, `.rmd`, and even Jupyter notebooks rely heavily on Markdown.

### Learning Markdown

Markdown is intentionally simple. You do not need to memorize everything at once.

Common uses in data science include:

* Writing `README.md` files
* Creating reports and assignments
* Documenting code and analysis notebooks

A concise reference is available here:
[Markdown cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Common Markdown commands

* **Headers**: `#`, `##`, `###` for section headings
* **Emphasis**: `*italic*`, `**bold**`
* **Lists**: ordered (`1.`) and unordered (`-`)
* **Links**: `[text](URL)`
* **Images**: `![alt text](image URL)`
* **Blockquotes**: `>`
* **Inline code**: `` `code` ``
* **Code blocks**: triple backticks
* **Horizontal rules**: `---` or `___`
* **Tables**: `|` and `-` syntax
* **Escaping characters**: `\`

You will gradually use these throughout the course as they appear naturally in assignments and projects.

## LaTeX

[Optional content]{.uugreen-bold}
This section can be covered briefly in class. Students can return to it when writing mathematical expressions, proofs, or formal reports.

LaTeX is not required for everyday writing in this course. However, **basic familiarity with LaTeX-style mathematics is essential**, especially for equations, models, and formal notation used in analytics, statistics, and machine learning.

## What LaTeX is (and why it matters)

LaTeX is a **typesetting system** designed for producing high-quality documents with complex structure, especially those containing mathematics, equations, references, and formal layouts.

Key ideas to understand:

* LaTeX uses **plain text with markup commands** to describe structure and meaning
* Content and presentation are deliberately separated
* Formatting decisions are handled by document classes and templates
* Mathematical notation is a first-class citizen

Because of this, LaTeX has become the standard for:

* Academic papers
* Theses and dissertations
* Journal submissions
* Technical and scientific documentation

Documents written in LaTeX are typically compiled into PDF files using engines such as `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.

For this course:

* You will **mostly write in Markdown**
* You are **not expected to be a LaTeX expert**
* You *are* expected to understand and use **LaTeX math syntax** when writing equations

Markdown-based tools (R Markdown, Quarto, Jupyter) all rely on LaTeX **under the hood** for math rendering.

## When you actually need LaTeX

You will encounter LaTeX most often in three situations:

1. **Mathematical expressions**

   * Equations
   * Models
   * Constraints
   * Optimization problems

2. **Formal reasoning**

   * Proof sketches
   * Theorems and propositions
   * Definitions and assumptions

3. **Publishing constraints**

   * Journals and conferences often provide LaTeX templates
   * Universities commonly distribute LaTeX thesis classes

Even when writing Markdown or Quarto documents, math is still written using LaTeX syntax.

## Strengths of LaTeX

The main strength of LaTeX is its **semantic clarity**:

* You describe *what* something is, not *how* it should look
* Equations scale correctly across formats
* Mathematical notation is precise and unambiguous
* Documents remain readable and editable as plain text

This is why LaTeX remains dominant in STEM disciplines.

## Writing mathematics with LaTeX

You will most often use LaTeX **inside Markdown or Quarto**, not in standalone `.tex` files.

### Math modes

- `$ ... $` - Inline math, used within sentences
- `$$ ... $$` - Display math, centered and on its own line
- `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}` - Numbered equations with labels
- `\begin{align} ... \end{align}` - Aligned, multi-line equations with numbering

Use inline math for symbols and short expressions, and display math for models and derivations.

## Core LaTeX math commands

These commands cover **most equations you will write in this course**.

:::{.columns}

:::{.column}
- `$ $` - Inline mathematical expressions
- `$$ $$` - Display mathematical expressions
- `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}` - Numbered equations
- `\begin{align} ... \end{align}` - Multi-line aligned equations
- `\frac{a}{b}` - Fractions
- `\sqrt{x}` - Square roots
- `\sum`, `\prod` - Summations and products
- `\int` - Integrals
:::

:::{.column}
- `\frac{d}{dx}` - Derivatives
- `\frac{\partial}{\partial x}` - Partial derivatives
- `\lim` - Limits
- `\infty` - Infinity
- `\pm`, `\mp` - Plus/minus symbols
- `\cdot`, `\times` - Multiplication
- `\left( \right)` - Auto-sized brackets
- `\alpha`, `\beta`, … - Greek letters
- `^`, `_` - Superscripts and subscripts
:::

:::

Example-

- `x^2` → ($x^2$)
- `a_{ij}` → ($a_{ij}$)

## Proofs, definitions, and theorems (conceptual)

While you will not write full formal proofs in this course, LaTeX provides standard structures for:

- Definitions
- Assumptions
- Propositions
- Theorems
- Proof sketches

In Markdown and Quarto, these are often expressed using **headings and math blocks**, rather than full LaTeX environments. The emphasis is on **clarity of reasoning**, not rigid formalism.

## Installing LaTeX for PDF output {#sec-latex}

To generate PDFs from Quarto or R Markdown, a LaTeX installation is required.

Instead of installing a full LaTeX distribution, we recommend using **TinyTeX**, a lightweight setup managed directly by Quarto.

Install TinyTeX with:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```

This installs LaTeX locally for Quarto only and does not interfere with other software.

To make TinyTeX available system-wide:

```bash
quarto install tinytex --update-path
```

For reference:

* Quarto PDF engines: [https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html)
* Other Quarto tools: see Section `#sec-tools`

## Learning resources

You do not need to memorize LaTeX. Use references as needed.

Recommended resources:

## Mathpix: a practical helper

* Mathpix: [https://mathpix.com/](https://mathpix.com/)

Mathpix converts images of handwritten or printed equations into LaTeX, Markdown, or MathML. It is especially useful when:

* Transcribing equations from slides or papers
* Converting handwritten notes into clean math
* Avoiding manual typing errors

## Markdown with code execution (R Markdown)

[Optional content]{.uugreen-bold}
This section provides historical and conceptual grounding. Students do not need to master R Markdown, but understanding it helps explain how modern reproducible tools evolved.

Markdown on its own is a lightweight way to write structured text. What made it transformative for data science was the ability to **execute code inside Markdown documents** and embed the results directly into the output.

That idea is what R Markdown introduced.

## What R Markdown adds to Markdown

At its core, **R Markdown** extends Markdown by allowing you to:

* Write narrative text in Markdown
* Embed executable R code chunks
* Automatically insert tables, figures, and results
* Render everything into a polished document

Mathematics written using LaTeX syntax works seamlessly inside R Markdown documents, which is why it became widely adopted in statistics, analytics, and academic research.

Conceptually, R Markdown sits between:

* literate programming (Sweave)
* and modern multi-language publishing tools (Quarto)

## Historical context

Markdown was originally created as a **text-to-HTML** tool so writers could produce web pages without writing raw HTML.

R Markdown builds on this idea by creating a *noweb-style* system for analytics:

* Text is written using Markdown
* Code is embedded in fenced code blocks
* Outputs are inserted during rendering

R Markdown was built on top of Yihui Xie’s **knitr** package and inherited most of its capabilities.

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
![](./images/ch04/rmarkdown.png){width=300}
:::

:::{.column width="70%"}
This design was inspired by `Sweave`.

* Narrative text uses Markdown syntax
* Code chunks are delimited using ` ```{r}`
* Chunk options control execution, visibility, and formatting
* Results are automatically woven into the document
:::
:::

## Code chunks (conceptual)

In R Markdown, executable code is written inside **code chunks**. Each chunk:

* Has a language (most commonly R)
* Can be executed during rendering
* Can show or hide code, output, warnings, or messages

You do not need to memorize chunk options now. The key idea is that **code and explanation live in the same document**, and the document itself becomes reproducible.

## Pandoc: the publishing engine underneath

R Markdown relies on **Pandoc**, a universal document converter that makes Markdown-based publishing powerful and flexible.

Pandoc allows a single source document to be converted into many output formats without rewriting content.

![](./images/ch04/pandoc.png){height=55%}

Pandoc supports a wide range of formats.

For this course, the most relevant are:

* HTML
* PDF
* Word
* PowerPoint

This capability is what enables “single source, many outputs.”

## What an R Markdown document looks like

The structure of an R Markdown document typically includes:

* A small metadata header (YAML)
* Markdown text
* Code chunks
* Embedded outputs (tables, figures, equations)

The image below shows how code, output, and narrative coexist naturally in a single document.

![Andrew Bray, rstudio::conf(2022)](./images/ch04/paste-00475E59.png)

## The R Markdown ecosystem

R Markdown developed a large ecosystem due to its extensibility. It has been used to create:

- Reports and documents
- Interactive documents and dashboards
- Presentations
- Books (via **bookdown**)
- Websites
- Journal-ready manuscripts (via **rticles**)

This ecosystem is one reason R Markdown became the dominant reproducible reporting tool in statistics and analytics for many years.

## Why we do not focus on R Markdown directly

While R Markdown is still widely used, it is **no longer the recommended end point** for new projects.

Its ideas live on—and are expanded—in **Quarto**, which:

* Supports multiple programming languages
* Uses the same Markdown foundation
* Builds on Pandoc
* Unifies workflows across R, Python, and Jupyter

For students, the takeaway is:

> Learn Markdown well.
> Understand how code execution works inside documents.
> Use Quarto as the modern, language-agnostic successor.


## Jupyter

[Optional content]{.uugreen-bold}
This section provides context. Jupyter is widely used and worth understanding, but it is not the final workflow we emphasize.

Jupyter introduced many students to **literate, interactive computing**. It combines code, text, and output in a single document and remains one of the most popular tools in data science.


## JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a web-based interactive development environment. It evolved from the original [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) interface and provides a more flexible workspace.

Core ideas:

* A **kernel** provides the computational engine
* Each notebook connects to exactly one kernel
* Many kernels are available beyond Python

Supported kernels include:

* Python
* R
* Julia
* SAS
* MATLAB
* JavaScript (Node.js)
* and many others
  ([full list](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels))

Text inside notebooks is written using **Markdown**, while executable code is organized into **cells**.

Jupyter outputs can be exported using the `nbconvert` tool into:

* HTML
* LaTeX
* PDF
* Markdown
* and other static formats

Entire collections of notebooks can be published as books using **Jupyter Book**:

* [https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)
* Examples: [https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html)

:::
:::{.column width="40%"}
![Source: jupyter.org](./images/ch04/jupyter.png)
:::
:::


## Why Jupyter is so popular

Jupyter notebooks are widely adopted because they are:

* Common in Kaggle competitions and exploratory analysis
* Integrated into cloud platforms such as:

  * Google Colab
  * Databricks
  * AWS SageMaker
* Usable directly inside VS Code and PyCharm
* Friendly for experimentation and rapid iteration

For many learners, Jupyter is the first exposure to combining code, explanation, and output.


## A structural limitation

[... But]{.bloodred-bold}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
![](./images/ch04/2egqlc.jpeg){height=350}
:::
:::{.column width="70%"}

> Jupyter notebooks are **order-dependent**.

Cells can be run in arbitrary order, which means:

* The visible code may not reflect execution order
* Hidden state can accumulate
* Reproducibility can suffer if notebooks are not carefully managed

While one can always “Run all cells” to restore order, this places responsibility on the user rather than the tool.

This limitation is not fatal, but it matters when moving from **exploration** to **communication and publication**.

## Quarto

Quarto is the next generation of reproducible publishing tools, developed by [Posit](https://www.posit.com). It generalizes the ideas behind R Markdown and Jupyter into a **single, consistent system**.

## Quarto overview

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a publishing framework designed for data science and technical communication.

Key characteristics:

* **Markdown-based**
  Write content using Markdown, including code and math.

* **Language-agnostic**
  Supports R, Python, Julia, JavaScript, and any Jupyter kernel.

* **Reproducible by design**
  Documents are rendered top-to-bottom with controlled execution.

* **Multiple outputs**
  HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and more.

* **Interactive**
  Supports interactive tables, charts, and widgets.

* **Extensible**
  Plugins, filters, and custom layouts are supported.

Quarto treats documents as **products**, not notebooks or scripts.

Quarto sits *above* these tools and languages. It does not replace them; it **coordinates them**.

## R Markdown and Quarto

Quarto builds on many ideas from R Markdown while expanding their scope.

| rmarkdown                  | quarto                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Requires R                 | Language-agnostic                              |
| Mature ecosystem           | Modern, unified system                         |
| Uses `knitr`               | Uses `knitr` or Jupyter                        |
| Multiple rendering engines | Uses Pandoc exclusively                        |
| Basic Markdown             | Extended Markdown (callouts, tabsets, layouts) |

Additional notes:

* Most Pandoc-based R Markdown documents render in Quarto
* Some legacy tools (e.g., `xaringan`) are not compatible
* Jupyter notebooks can be used directly as Quarto sources
* Any Jupyter kernel can be used, not just Python

## Single source, many outputs

A central idea behind Quarto is **single source publishing**.

From one source document containing:

* Text
* Code
* Results
* Figures

You can generate:

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="47%"}

* Documents

  * HTML
  * Word
  * PDF
* Presentations

  * HTML
  * PowerPoint
:::
:::{.column width="47%"}
* Websites and blogs
* Books
* Dashboards
* Interactive reports
* Journal-ready articles
:::
:::

Most R Markdown documents already follow this philosophy; Quarto makes it consistent across languages.


## Installation

Quarto is a **standalone application**, not an R or Python package.

Installation instructions:

* [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

![](./images/ch04/quarto-steps.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}


## So, do we like Quarto?

Yes — with nuance.

* R Markdown continues to work well and remains widely used
* Jupyter is excellent for exploration and teaching
* Quarto unifies both approaches and adds:

  * Better structure
  * Better publishing
  * First-class Python support
  * Strong presentation tools

:::{.notes}
There is nothing “wrong” with R Markdown or Jupyter.

Quarto extends their ideas and gives Python an equivalent of what R users have long had: a serious, reproducible publishing workflow.

Its strongest advantage is not computation, but communication.
:::


Great choice — this works very well as a **capstone framing** for the chapter. Below is a **clean, student-facing decision guide** that is concise, principled, and aligned with how you actually want them to work in the course. It avoids tool evangelism and focuses on *intent*.


## Choosing the right tool: a practical guide

This course exposes you to multiple tools not because you must use all of them, but because **different stages of analytical work call for different environments**.

The goal is not tool loyalty.
The goal is **clarity, reproducibility, and communication**.

:::{.panel-tabset}
### Jupyter

Jupyter is best suited for **exploration and experimentation**.

Choose Jupyter if you are:

* Exploring a new dataset
* Testing ideas interactively
* Prototyping models or visualizations
* Learning a new library or API
* Working in cloud environments (Colab, Databricks, SageMaker)
* Iterating rapidly without worrying about final presentation

Jupyter shines when you want immediate feedback and flexibility.

**Caution:**
Before sharing or submitting a notebook, always:

* Restart the kernel
* Run all cells top-to-bottom
* Verify that results are reproducible


### R Markdown

R Markdown is best for **R-centered analytical reporting**.

Choose R Markdown if you are:

* Working primarily in R
* Creating structured reports or homework assignments
* Writing statistical analyses with embedded math
* Using an existing R Markdown template or journal format
* Building documents that rely heavily on the R ecosystem

R Markdown remains a strong and mature option, especially in R-heavy workflows.

### Quarto

Quarto is best for **final products and public-facing work**.

Choose Quarto if you are:

* Working primarily in R
* Creating structured reports or homework assignments
* Writing statistical analyses with embedded math
* Using an existing R Markdown template or journal format
* Building documents that rely heavily on the R ecosystem

R Markdown remains a strong and mature option, especially in R-heavy workflows.

Quarto is best for **final products and public-facing work**.

Choose Quarto if you are:

* Writing reproducible reports meant to be read by others
* Creating course deliverables (reports, slides, websites)
* Working across R and Python in the same project
* Publishing content to HTML, PDF, or Word
* Building presentations or course websites
* Planning to reuse the same content in multiple formats

Quarto emphasizes **structure, consistency, and polish**.


:::

## A typical workflow in this course

Most projects will naturally follow this pattern:

1. **Explore** in Jupyter

   * Load data
   * Experiment
   * Debug
   * Prototype

2. **Formalize** in Quarto

   * Clean the analysis
   * Add narrative and interpretation
   * Insert equations and figures
   * Ensure reproducibility

3. **Publish** using Quarto

   * Render to HTML, PDF, or slides
   * Share with instructors or peers
   * Archive for future reference

You are encouraged to **move between tools**, not choose one forever.

## Summary table

| Task                      | Recommended tool |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Rapid experimentation     | Jupyter          |
| Learning and prototyping  | Jupyter          |
| R-based reporting         | R Markdown       |
| Reproducible assignments  | Quarto           |
| Final reports and papers  | Quarto           |
| Presentations             | Quarto           |
| Websites and portfolios   | Quarto           |
| Mixed R + Python projects | Quarto           |

## Final takeaway

Think in terms of **intent**, not software.

* Jupyter helps you *think*
* R Markdown helps you *analyze*
* Quarto helps you *communicate*

The most important skill you will develop is not proficiency with a tool, but the ability to **move cleanly from exploration to explanation**.

## Course requirements and practical Quarto usage

This course uses **Quarto as the standard publishing system** for websites, reports, and presentations.

### Course requirements

* All **project websites and presentations must be built using Quarto**
* You are **strongly encouraged to use `.qmd` files**, not `.ipynb`, for published content
* Jupyter notebooks are fine for exploration, but Quarto is required for final deliverables

Functionally, `.qmd` and `.ipynb` files are similar:
both are **Markdown + executable code**.

The key difference is execution behavior:

* `.ipynb` stores outputs inside the file
* `.qmd` re-runs code during rendering

  * This improves reproducibility
  * Caching options exist for expensive computations

If a `.qmd` file contains no code, it behaves like a standard Markdown file.

## What Quarto gives you (at a glance)

Quarto allows you to combine, in one source file:

* Narrative text (Markdown)
* Mathematical notation (LaTeX-style math)
* Code (R, Python, or other kernels)
* Figures, tables, and diagrams
* Interactive and static outputs

From that single source, you can generate:

* HTML documents and websites
* PDF reports
* Word or PowerPoint files
* Presentations
* Books and blogs

This is the **“single source, many outputs”** principle.

## A minimal Quarto example

```markdown
- Inline math example: $f(x)=\frac{e^{x^2}}{2}$

$$

If you understand this, you already understand the core of Quarto authoring.


## Beyond the basics

Quarto also supports:

* Multi-column layouts
* Figure grids
* Diagrams (Mermaid, Graphviz)
* Embedded video
* Rich document metadata via YAML

You will learn these **incrementally** through labs and examples.
You are **not expected to memorize syntax** at this stage.

## Key takeaway

> Use Jupyter to explore
> Use Quarto to communicate

Your goal is not to master every feature immediately, but to develop a **clean, reproducible publishing habit** that scales from homework to research to professional work.

## Citations and bibliographies

Correct citation and attribution are **non-negotiable** in academic and professional work.

This is not only about avoiding plagiarism; it is about:

* intellectual honesty
* reproducibility
* traceability of ideas and evidence

In analytics and research, managing citations early saves significant time later.


## How citations work in modern workflows

In Quarto (and other Pandoc-based systems), citations are **data**, not formatting.

The workflow is:

1. Store references in a reference manager
2. Export them to a citation file (usually `.bib`)
3. Cite sources using short citation keys
4. Let Quarto generate the bibliography automatically

You never format references by hand.

## Reference management tools

A **reference manager** stores, organizes, and exports citations.

Most reference managers can:

* search online databases
* import PDFs and metadata
* annotate and organize papers
* generate citation files
* insert citations into documents

Two widely used free options are:

* **Zotero** — [https://www.zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org)
* **Mendeley** — [https://www.mendeley.com](https://www.mendeley.com)

Both:

* store references in a single library
* attach PDFs and notes
* provide browser extensions for one-click import
* export `.bib` files compatible with Quarto
* automatically generate citation keys

Zotero is one of the citation tools recommended by many university libraries.

## BibTeX (what you need to know)

**BibTeX** is a reference file format originally developed with LaTeX and now widely used across Markdown and Pandoc workflows.

You do **not** need to write BibTeX entries by hand, but you should understand their structure.

A typical entry looks like this:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

```code
@article{article_key,
  author  = {Peter Adams}, 
  title   = {The title of the work},
  journal = {The name of the journal},
  year    = 1993,
  volume  = 4,
  number  = 2,
  pages   = {201--213}
}
```

:::
::: {.column width="55%"}

* The most important part is the **citation key** (`article_key`)
* This is what you use to cite the work in your document
* Common entry types include:

  * `@article`
  * `@book`
  * `@unpublished`
    :::
    ::::

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
You should generate these entries using a reference manager, not manually.

## Citations in Quarto

Quarto supports multiple citation file formats via Pandoc.

| Format   | File extension |
| -------- | -------------- |
| BibTeX   | `.bib`         |
| BibLaTeX | `.bibtex`      |
| CSL JSON | `.json`        |
| CSL YAML | `.yaml`        |
| RIS      | `.ris`         |

Most students will use **BibTeX (`.bib`)**.

## Adding citations to a Quarto document

### Step 1: Point to your bibliography file

In the YAML header of your `.qmd` file:

```yaml
---
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Specify a citation style

Citation styles are defined using **CSL (Citation Style Language)** files.

Styles can be downloaded from:

* [https://www.zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles)

Add the style to your YAML:

```yaml
---
csl: nature.csl
---
```

Place the `.csl` file in the same folder as your document.

## Citing sources in the text

Citations are written using Pandoc syntax:

* Single citation: `[@citation_key]`
* Multiple citations: `[@key1; @key2]`

Example:

![](./images/ch04/citations.png)

Quarto automatically:

* formats in-text citations
* generates the bibliography
* applies the selected citation style

## Where the bibliography appears

Pandoc places the bibliography:

* inside a `div` with id `refs` if it exists
* otherwise at the end of the document

To control placement:

```markdown
### References

::: {#refs}
:::
```

---

## Citation styles

Different fields require different citation styles.

Examples:

::: {layout-ncol=3}

![American Statistical Association](./images/ch04/asa.png)

![Nature](./images/ch04/nature.png)

![Chicago](./images/ch04/chicago.png)

:::

The same source file can be rendered in different styles simply by switching the `.csl` file.

---

## Key takeaway

> Write once.
> Cite with keys.
> Let the system format everything.

If you maintain a clean reference library and a single `.bib` file, citations become **infrastructure**, not overhead.
