# Introduction

As data and computation continue to reshape disciplines across the university, faculty are increasingly called upon to integrate code, collaboration, and scalable infrastructure into their teaching. Yet, despite this growing demand, instructors often lack structured guidance on how to develop and maintain reproducible instructional materials across tools, platforms, and modalities.

**Teach Reproducibly** is a faculty-facing resource developed by the **Metropolitan College**, in partnership with **BU ELIVE Services** and **BU Virtual**, to support instructors in building robust, version-controlled, and scalable course content for use in **Boston University’s Blackboard Ultra environment**.

This book provides practical guidance for instructors teaching in data-rich and computation-heavy domains — including analytics, computer science, statistics, engineering, public health, and beyond — who are committed to developing high-quality, maintainable instructional workflows.

# What This Book Offers

Rather than focusing solely on curriculum content, this book emphasizes **how content is developed, maintained, and shared reproducibly**. It introduces foundational tools and design principles that support instructional reuse, transparency, and collaboration, including:

* Literate programming environments with **Quarto**
* Source control and team workflows using **Git and GitHub**
* Collaborative assignments via **GitHub Classroom**
* Cloud-based computing with **AWS Academy** and **VS Code.dev**
* Browser-native runtime environments such as **WebR** and **Pyodide**
* Seamless integration with **Blackboard Ultra** and BU’s LMS ecosystem

This resource supports faculty in developing modular instructional pipelines, enabling version-controlled teaching materials, reproducible research-in-practice demonstrations, and seamless cloud-backed student exercises. Each module aligns with BU’s pedagogical standards and technical infrastructure.
