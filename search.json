    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis book is a practical, end-to-end guide for educators, instructional designers, and academic technologists who want to modernize how they develop, organize, and deliver course materials. It brings together version control, reproducible documents, Quarto publishing, and Blackboard Ultra integration into a unified workflow that is scalable, maintainable, and future-proof.\nThe goal of this book is not only to show you what tools to use, but also how these tools work together to form a complete course-production pipeline—one that enhances instructional quality while reducing long-term maintenance effort.\nTo achieve this, the book is organized into several core skill domains that build on one another.",

This chapter guides you through installing and configuring:\n\nGit, Git LFS, Github CLI, and GitHub\nAntigravity IDE (Google’s VS Code–based environment with agents and extensions)\nQuarto CLI\nPython 3.12\n\nvirtual environments\npip, setuptools, wheel\npandas, numpy, openpyxl, and matplotlib\n\nR, RTools (Windows), and renv\nPandoc and Graphviz\nCore Antigravity plugins for Jupyter, Quarto, Python, and remote development\n\nBy the end of this section, you will have a fully functional authoring environment where Quarto, Git, and Blackboard workflows run reliably.\nThis chapter ensures every user starts with a stable, consistent toolset, preventing configuration issues later in the course.",

Each step includes instructions, verification checks, and placeholders for screenshots.\nGit is the version control system used throughout the recommended workflow.
