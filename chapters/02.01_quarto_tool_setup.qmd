# Introduction

Welcome to Module 0. Before beginning analytics, Quarto development, and programming workflows, students must install and configure:

* Git & GitHub
* Antigravity (Google’s VS Code–based IDE)
* Quarto
* Python
* R
* Pandoc
* Graphviz

This module ensures every student has:

* a working IDE
* version control correctly configured
* environments set up
* the ability to edit, preview, and publish Quarto content
* a GitHub Pages site (`username.github.io`)
* experience with pull → edit → commit → push workflows

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Install Git, GitHub CLI, Quarto, Pandoc, Graphviz, Python 3.12, R, and RTools (Windows).
* Install Antigravity and required plugins (Jupyter, Python, Quarto, Remote).
* Configure Git + SSH authentication.
* Create your GitHub Pages repository: `username.github.io`.
* Clone, edit, commit, push, and pull changes.
* Verify installation with screenshots and documentation.
